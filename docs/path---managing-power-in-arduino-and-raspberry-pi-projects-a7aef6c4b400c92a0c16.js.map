A voltage divider is a very simple circuit to turn a large voltage into a smaller one. Using just two series resistors and an input voltage, we can create an output voltage that is a fraction of the input.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/volt-div.png\\\" alt=\\\"voltage divider\\\"></p>\\n<p>The output voltage will be determined by the ratio of the two resistor which can be calculated with this equation:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>It’s easy to see that if we simply add two resistors with the same resistance the output voltage will be halved:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Vout = 5V * (1000 / (1000 + 1000))\\nVout = 5V * 0.5\\nVout = 2.5V</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can control the output voltage by changing the resistance of one of the resistors. There’s also nothing preventing you from changing one of the resistors to a potentiometer or a light dependent resistor as these are just special types of resistors that can change their resistance value depending on user input or environmental light changes.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most basic circuits in electronics so it's important to discuss if it can or can't be used to supply power to a load.</p>\\n<p><strong>The short answer is NO: a voltage divider circuit can't be used as a power supply.</strong></p>\\n<p>Voltage divider circuits are often used in sensors where only a small amount of current is passing.</p>\\n<p>If this circuit was used as a power supply, the current required by the load would have to pass through one of the resistors which produces power that is dissipated in the form of heat. If the power is higher than the rating of the resistor (usually maximum 1 W) the heat could potentially melt the component.</p>\\n<p>Heat and melting is just one of the problems, the inefficient nature of this circuit is another: dissipating power in the form of heat is a waste of energy.</p>\\n<p>You can read more about the light dependent resistor and measuring light in my free Ebook that you can download right below this post.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"power-shield\\\"><a href=\\\"#power-shield\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Power Shield</h3>\\n<p>The super easy option to power your Arduino project is to use a power shield.

Just make sure you buy a standard 2.1 mm centre positive barrel jack connector.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"voltage-regulator\\\"><a href=\\\"#voltage-regulator\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Voltage regulator</h3>\\n<p>In case your input voltage is not as high as 230 V and not AC but you still need 5 V output then you can just use a simple 5 V voltage regulator. This chunky regulator will help you get your 7-35 V DC input to a nice clean 5 V.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/voltage-regulator.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"voltage regulator\\\"></p>\\n<p>I used one of these in my 12 V RGB LED light project where I powered the LED ribbon from a 12 V AC-DC mains adapter then used a 5 V voltage regulator to power the Particle Photon dev board from the same adapter. This way I didn’t have to introduce another 230 V AC-DC converter with a different output just used the already regulated 12 V input and regulated that further down to 5 V.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"/ikea-social-notification-desk-lamp\\\">Here</a> you can find more details about this project.</p>\\n<p>Voltage regulators are cheap and very easy to work with, but keep in mind that they are not very efficient, compared to transformers like the AC-DC adapters we have already mentioned, as they dissipate the regulated voltage in the form of heat.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"step-down\\\"><a href=\\\"#step-down\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Step-down</h3>\\n<p>Next up, we have a tiny module that takes inputs between 4.5 V and 7 V and outputs regulated 3.3 V for your ESP8266 or other dev boards.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/step-down-converter.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"step down module\\\"></p>\\n<p>This works with 5 V USB power, three or four AA or AAA batteries, or if you have a 5 V or 6 V wall adapter.</p>\\n<p>This step-down component is essentially just a voltage regulator in a nicer module form.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"voltage-divider-circuit\\\"><a href=\\\"#voltage-divider-circuit\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Voltage divider circuit</h3>\\n<p>Finally, let’s mention the voltage divider circuit which is the simplest of all. A voltage divider is a very simple circuit to turn a large voltage into a smaller one. Using just two series resistors and an input voltage, we can create an output voltage that is a fraction of the input.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/volt-div.png\\\" alt=\\\"voltage divider\\\"></p>\\n<p>The output voltage will be determined by the ratio of the two resistor which can be calculated with this equation:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2))</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>It’s easy to see that if we simply add two resistors with the same resistance the output voltage will be halved:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Vout = 5V * (1000 / (1000 + 1000))\\nVout = 5V * 0.5\\nVout = 2.5V</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can control the output voltage by changing the resistance of one of the resistors. There’s also nothing preventing you from changing one of the resistors to a potentiometer or a light dependent resistor as these are just special types of resistors that can change their resistance value depending on user input or environmental light changes.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most basic circuits in electronics so it's important to discuss if it can or can't be used to supply power to a load.</p>\\n<p><strong>The short answer is NO: a voltage divider circuit can't be used as a power supply.</strong></p>\\n<p>Voltage divider circuits are often used in sensors where only a small amount of current is passing.</p>\\n<p>If this circuit was used as a power supply, the current required by the load would have to pass through one of the resistors which produces power that is dissipated in the form of heat. If the power is higher than the rating of the resistor (usually maximum 1 W) the heat could potentially melt the component.</p>\\n<p>Heat and melting is just one of the problems, the inefficient nature of this circuit is another: dissipating power in the form of heat is a waste of energy.</p>\\n<p>You can read more about the light dependent resistor and measuring light in my free Ebook that you can download right below this post.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"power-shield\\\"><a href=\\\"#power-shield\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Power Shield</h3>\\n<p>The super easy option to power your Arduino project is to use a power shield.
