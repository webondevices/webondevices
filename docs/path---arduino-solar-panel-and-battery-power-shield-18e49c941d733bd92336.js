This is possible because the internal circuit boosts the 3.6 V battery power to a regulated 5 V level that the Arduino or other USB powered devices usually require.</p>\n<p><strong>Charging the on-board battery can be done in two ways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charge through the micro <strong>USB port</strong> on the right side of the board (regular phone charger port)</li>\n<li>Or connect a <strong>solar panel</strong> to the dedicated ports on the shield (panel comes with the board)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/solar-panel.jpg" alt="Solar Panel"></p>\n<p>The solar panel is a very exciting feature! With the help of the panel, and a carefully planned project, you can essentially run your Arduino UNO project forever. Or as long as the sun shines :)</p>\n<p>I tested the Energy Shield with my brand new talking plant project (post coming soon) and it was working perfectly:</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/solar-panel-lili.jpg" alt="Lili"></p>\n<h3 id="design-and-production"><a href="#design-and-production" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Design and production</h3>\n<p>Building this custom power shield was a lot of work. First, the board and circuit was carfully designed in EAGLE. The board has a charge and a boost circuit all working simultaneously responsible for managing the power inputs and outputs:</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/prototyping.jpg" alt="eagle"></p>\n<p>Next step is to find a company that can manufacture custom PCB boards with the designs you exported from EAGLE. You will also need to purchase individual components in bulk from Ebay, Aliexpress or Alibaba:</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/prototype-pcb.jpg" alt="components"></p>\n<p>Then depending on your budget, you get the PCB manufacturing company to assemble your prototype, or you do it yourself by hand:</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/energy-shield-prototype.jpg" alt="prototype"></p>\n<p>At this stage, if you are as unlucky as we were, you discover a few issues and mistakes and amend your designs in EAGLE and order a new batch of PCBs.</p>\n<p>Once the PCBs are working perfectly you can start assemblying the boards and put them through a lot of testing.</p>\n<p><img src="http://www.webondevices.com/posts/2018/wod-energy-shield.jpg" alt="finishedboard"></p>\n<h3 id="availability"><a href="#availability" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Availability</h3>\n<p>The Energy Shield is ready for mass production but it’s currently in the testing phase.
